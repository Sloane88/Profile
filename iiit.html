  <h1 style="text-align:center;">Interest In IT</h1>

  <p>My Interest in IT has always been in the background of my life when I think about it. The curiosity of how things work because of a problem that needed solving or advancement to make things easier and more efficient for the betterment of the human race <em>(most of the time)</em>. I believe that the world needs more people to help problem solve and develop technologies for future global and regional issues, whether it be food shortages, green energy advancement or increasing network capabilities for better communication for regional and remote areas. I know IT will have a place in the middle of it if not the majority. I guess my curiosity and drive to get into the industry and start this course is wanting to make a possible input, to hopefully steer the planet to a more sustainable and richer environment.
  </p>

  <p>My second reason revolves around the possible future work office being the ‘home office’. Having the option to be on the back of a van while travelling through NZ or on the desk of a boat docked in the Mentawais <em>(the dream,</em> though there is probably is limited internet). But, realistically the chances are it will be in the home. Which would allow the flexibility for my future family and household.
  </p>
  <p>My curiosity about IT is what has encouraged me to take this course. The problem-solving component and ever-changing landscape have to be some of the main factors that grab my attention. Being in health care for over a decade now, I have found myself fairly bored with the current routine. In saying that, I'm very proud of what my business partner and I have accomplished over the last 5 years and the people we have been able to help in the Wide Bay area. But unfortunately, The human body hasn’t changed that much in a hundred years and there are really no advancements when it comes to manual therapy. Just better management of the same condition but people mostly don’t want to adhere to the latest and greatest rehabilitation programs they just want the issue gone. Which has over time drained my passion for the job.
  </p>

  <p>RMIT is an institution I’m familiar with by having offered student osteopaths their first job out of uni. I have had the pleasure to work with these young professionals over the last 4 years. They have shown amazing dedication, knowledge and job-ready skills and have been valuable assets to the business and have helped it grow to what it is today.  Comparing other student osteopaths from other tertiary institutions RMIT has really set the standard for what it means to be job-ready as a new graduate osteopath. So when I saw the option for a diploma in IT I didn't hesitate.
  </p>

  <p>Through this course, I hope to get more clarity on where I may want to continue or direct further studies in the IT spectrum. What skill sets I will need to grasp and accomplish to achieve a future job and career in this ever-growing industry of the future. Or just learn for my pure interest.
