  <h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Ideal job!</strong> - <em>I think…..</em></h1>

  <p>With my limited knowledge of the IT industry over the last couple of months, I have been looking into different career paths.  I still believe it is way too early to say what direction I really want to go in. But more recently I have been interested in knowing more about Network engineering and management. This field seems to be interesting and overwhelming but necessary in today's world and hopefully the future. I have found an advertisement for an It company called <b>‘Talent’</b> looking for a Network engineer.
  </p>

  <p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/57236517?type=standout#sol=211745295bfba416c102591e2bf65bc6920ab619">Network Engineer - Talent</a></p>

  <p>The job Description details that the successful applicant would have responsibilities ranging from.
  </p>

  <ul>

  <li>Audits to the current infrastructure - <em>In my words</em> - testing the current infrastructure to make sure it’s working efficiently and that it's up to date.
  </li>
  <li>Developing Migration plans - <em>In my words</em> - changing and updating systems where information has to be transferred seamlessly</li>
  <li>Communicating with technical teams, and business stakeholders - <em>In my words</em> - Being able to communicate if not be the middle man between the two. </li>
  <li>Network switch upgrades including configuration changes - <em>In my words</em> - updating physical in-house systems </li>
  <li>Documentation and handover to operational teams - <em>In my words</em> - day-to-day operations.
  </li>
  </ul>

  <p>With this particular role what they are asking is 3-5 years of commercial experience. They also ask for very common attributes that you can find in most professional setting jobs e.g. working well in a team environment, time management skills, working to deadlines etc. I feel I am proficient in all these areas due to my current and past working career. I thoroughly enjoy working with people on set tasks and planning how to get the task done and done to the highest quality
  </p>

  <p>There are some very IT-specific skills which again seem very overwhelming and interesting. I also have little to no idea about these qualifications. </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Being proficient with Cisco Enterprise or an entry-level IT Certification -(heard about it never looked into it) </li>
    <li>Good understanding of VLAN configuration and principles (a quick google search confirmed I have no idea about it)
  </li>
    <li>Understanding of Python scripting language (Have tried my hand at python a couple of times but never really stuck with it due to its complexity and my lack of understanding)
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>    <p>To be a possible candidate for this role, will require me to learn multiple aspects of IT which I hope through my studies I will attain and be able to develop. I do think enrolling in a crash course in python or any other script language will only benefit me as well alongside my tertiary education. As well as, the Subject selection which will be crucial to cross into the Bachelor of Engineering (Computer and Network Engineering) <em>(any help with is would be amazing)</em>. Through my uni years, I will reach out to this company as well and see if they offer any intern positions over uni break to help get my foot in the door.
