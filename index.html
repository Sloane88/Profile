<h1 style="text-align:center;">These days</h1>

<p> I'm a business owner in Hervey bay and have been here since 2018 - Bay Osteopathy & Injury Rehabilitation</p>

<p>I have a 2 ½ old Labrador called Soda - Extra marks if you get the Seinfeld quote!</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Interest In IT</h1>

<p>My Interest in IT has always been in the background of my life when I think about it. The curiosity of how things work because of a problem that needed solving or advancement to make things easier and more efficient for the betterment of the human race <em>(most of the time)</em>. I believe that the world needs more people to help problem solve and develop technologies for future global and regional issues, whether it be food shortages, green energy advancement or increasing network capabilities for better communication for regional and remote areas. I know IT will have a place in the middle of it if not the majority. I guess my curiosity and drive to get into the industry and start this course is wanting to make a possible input, to hopefully steer the planet to a more sustainable and richer environment.
</p>

<p>My second reason revolves around the possible future work office being the ‘home office’. Having the option to be on the back of a van while travelling through NZ or on the desk of a boat docked in the Mentawais <em>(the dream,</em> though there is probably is limited internet). But, realistically the chances are it will be in the home. Which would allow the flexibility for my future family and household.
</p>
<p>My curiosity about IT is what has encouraged me to take this course. The problem-solving component and ever-changing landscape have to be some of the main factors that grab my attention. Being in health care for over a decade now, I have found myself fairly bored with the current routine. In saying that, I'm very proud of what my business partner and I have accomplished over the last 5 years and the people we have been able to help in the Wide Bay area. But unfortunately, The human body hasn’t changed that much in a hundred years and there are really no advancements when it comes to manual therapy. Just better management of the same condition but people mostly don’t want to adhere to the latest and greatest rehabilitation programs they just want the issue gone. Which has over time drained my passion for the job.
</p>

<p>RMIT is an institution I’m familiar with by having offered student osteopaths their first job out of uni. I have had the pleasure to work with these young professionals over the last 4 years. They have shown amazing dedication, knowledge and job-ready skills and have been valuable assets to the business and have helped it grow to what it is today.  Comparing other student osteopaths from other tertiary institutions RMIT has really set the standard for what it means to be job-ready as a new graduate osteopath. So when I saw the option for a diploma in IT I didn't hesitate.
</p>

<p>Through this course, I hope to get more clarity on where I may want to continue or direct further studies in the IT spectrum. What skill sets I will need to grasp and accomplish to achieve a future job and career in this ever-growing industry of the future. Or just learn for my pure interest.
</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Ideal job!</strong> - <em>I think…..</em></h1>

<p>With my limited knowledge of the IT industry over the last couple of months, I have been looking into different career paths.  I still believe it is way too early to say what direction I really want to go in. But more recently I have been interested in knowing more about Network engineering and management. This field seems to be interesting and overwhelming but necessary in today's world and hopefully the future. I have found an advertisement for an It company called <b>‘Talent’</b> looking for a Network engineer.
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/57236517?type=standout#sol=211745295bfba416c102591e2bf65bc6920ab619">Network Engineer - Talent</a></p>

<p>The job Description details that the successful applicant would have responsibilities ranging from.
</p>

<ul>

<li>Audits to the current infrastructure - <em>In my words</em> - testing the current infrastructure to make sure it’s working efficiently and that it's up to date.
</li>
<li>Developing Migration plans - <em>In my words</em> - changing and updating systems where information has to be transferred seamlessly</li>
<li>Communicating with technical teams, and business stakeholders - <em>In my words</em> - Being able to communicate if not be the middle man between the two. </li>
<li>Network switch upgrades including configuration changes - <em>In my words</em> - updating physical in-house systems </li>
<li>Documentation and handover to operational teams - <em>In my words</em> - day-to-day operations.
</li>
</ul>

<p>With this particular role what they are asking is 3-5 years of commercial experience. They also ask for very common attributes that you can find in most professional setting jobs e.g. working well in a team environment, time management skills, working to deadlines etc. I feel I am proficient in all these areas due to my current and past working career. I thoroughly enjoy working with people on set tasks and planning how to get the task done and done to the highest quality
</p>

<p>There are some very IT-specific skills which again seem very overwhelming and interesting. I also have little to no idea about these qualifications. </p>

<ul>
  <li> Being proficient with Cisco Enterprise or an entry-level IT Certification -(heard about it never looked into it) </li>
  <li>Good understanding of VLAN configuration and principles (a quick google search confirmed I have no idea about it)
</li>
  <li>Understanding of Python scripting language (Have tried my hand at python a couple of times but never really stuck with it due to its complexity and my lack of understanding)
</li>
</ul>
<p>    <p>To be a possible candidate for this role, will require me to learn multiple aspects of IT which I hope through my studies I will attain and be able to develop. I do think enrolling in a crash course in python or any other script language will only benefit me as well alongside my tertiary education. As well as, the Subject selection which will be crucial to cross into the Bachelor of Engineering (Computer and Network Engineering) <em>(any help with is would be amazing)</em>. Through my uni years, I will reach out to this company as well and see if they offer any intern positions over uni break to help get my foot in the door.

  <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
  <h3>Myers-Briggs test - Protagonist Personality - ENFJ-A
</h3>
<p>Definition - A Protagonist (ENFJ) is a person with the Extroverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging personality traits. These warm, forthright types love helping others, and they tend to have strong ideas and values. They back their perspective with the creative energy to achieve their goals.
</p>

<h3>Learning style test - Visual Learner
</h3>

<p>Definition - prefer to use pictures, images and spatial understanding to learn new material. You tend to remember what you see over what you hear and prefer to read/write, rather than listen to information.
</p>

<h3>Nerdy Personality Attributes Scale - Score 49
</h3>

<h3>What do the results of these tests mean?</h3>

<p>In a couple of ways, it does loosely make sense with the personality attributes. I have always found that I like to think of myself in these ways. But I have never acted towards these attributes it more or less just seems like the right thing to do at the time. I’ve always known I was a visual learner. To see a task in front of me and pull it apart to simplify the topic to get a deeper and clearer understanding. For the nerd test, I thought I might have scored higher. I have never considered myself a nerd but have been drawn to nerdy things and have been ridiculed because of a new hobby that is seen as nerdy - 4 years and too much money on Warhammer when I was a teenager
</p>

<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>

<p>I think my personality does encourage people to feel welcome and not judged. I always try to involve others and make sure that no one is left behind or doesn’t have their voice heard. The only drawback I see is that I prefer to visually see the breakdown of the task/assignment. Being an online course there may be some challenges I will encounter</p>

<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?
</h3>

</p>With teamwork, I feel the biggest issue is when you have people together that learn in different ways. I have always been comfortable working with both extra/introverts finding a common interest to build from and allowing people to get their ideas heard. But when some people can mentally map out and understand a topic I have been lost and felt like I was letting the team down.
