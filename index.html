<h1 style="text-align:center;">These days</h1>

<p> I'm a business owner in Hervey bay and have been here since 2018 - Bay Osteopathy & Injury Rehabilitation</p>

<p>I have a 2 ½ old Labrador called Soda - Extra marks if you get the Seinfeld quote!</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Interest In IT</h1>

<p>My Interest in IT has always been in the background of my life when I think about it. The curiosity of how things work because of a problem that needed solving or advancement to make things easier and more efficient for the betterment of the human race <em>(most of the time)</em>. I believe that the world needs more people to help problem solve and develop technologies for future global and regional issues, whether it be food shortages, green energy advancement or increasing network capabilities for better communication for regional and remote areas. I know IT will have a place in the middle of it if not the majority. I guess my curiosity and drive to get into the industry and start this course is wanting to make a possible input, to hopefully steer the planet to a more sustainable and richer environment.
</p>

<p>My second reason revolves around the possible future work office being the ‘home office’. Having the option to be on the back of a van while travelling through NZ or on the desk of a boat docked in the Mentawais <em>(the dream,</em> though there is probably is limited internet). But, realistically the chances are it will be in the home. Which would allow the flexibility for my future family and household.
