  <h2> <em>Discovered Wax</em>
  </h2>

  <p>My idea is to create an app that helps religious and new vinyl users discover new music and records with their phone that analysis either the bar code or the picture on the album cover and gives a detailed description and preference to whether the user would like the record based on their current collection and previous searches.
  </p>

  <p>There will be a database of albums that are added progressively by crowdsourcing data. As the users grow their own discography they will be adding to the whole cloud. Along with creating a community by contributing to ratings for different albums. There are forums where people can rate, record their own collection and discuss all things music.  Basically think <em><b>Vinvino meets Spotify + vinyl!!</b></em>
  </p>

  <h3>Why???</h3>

  <p>Vinyl has been on its way back in a big way over the last 10 years. In Australia alone from 2010, there were 39,644 LPs in retail sold - shooting forward to 2017 there were 786,735 sold. This isn’t including purchases at garage sales and swap meets. In the Us in 2010, there were 2.8mil records sold compared to 2021 41.7 mil.</p>

  <p>An issue with beginning record collectors today is that as beautiful as the covers are unless you know what you are after you can easily get lost in the artwork. A lot of beginner record collectors when they are starting out just buy records to fill empty space around their record player to make it look like they have been doing it for a while. Unfortunately, a lot of those records just collect dust because it wasn’t what the individual was after or actually likes. There is also a real trend with most vinyl collectors is to discover music that they will like and that no one else has heard of. This is where the ‘Discovered Wax’ app will help you find a unique album or help you save your money by minimising the gamble. Think of being the kid with the coolest music and knowing that you can tell your friends and know that they can’t just download it straight away!!!
  </p>

  <h3>So what is it??</h3>


  <p>Discovered wax will be a simple app-based program that helps users get a better understanding of what vinyl record they are thinking of purchasing when in either a shop e.g. Jb HiFi/shop or Vinyl meet and garage sales. The idea is to streamline the buying process and to help educate the user with certain information by simply taking a photo of either bar code or the album cover
  </p>

  <p>In the application after taking a photo, you will receive information ranging from
  </p>


  <li>Band Name
  </li>
  <li>Album name
  </li>
  <li>Year it was released
  </li>
  <li>Tracklist
  </li>
  <li>Rating based on crowdsourcing
  </li>
  <li>The average price for the record </li>
  <li>Preferencing based on your current collection and previous purchases</li>

  <p>This App will create a global community for vinyl lovers to share and show their collection as well as critique new and old releases. Show photos of their current record-player set up from the full-fledged audiophile to the budget beginner. It will have forums where you can ask questions about gear and purchases and even be able to swap records and have a list of upcoming meets in major cities etc.
  </p>

  <p>The application will serve as a shop as well for people to order specific records and a platform for other record businesses to sell their products directly to a growing user base. The application will take 3-10% commission for providing a service but will also save a lot of revenue by not having to have costly storage and pay for employees for the manual preparations. This will be the main source of income which will be shipped globally.  Along with advertisement rights for music and audio equipment companies to market their products directly to a dedicated customer base. There is also the potential to sell and offer aggregated rating data to other businesses.
  </p>

  <p>At face value, the app will appear to be fairly simplistic for the beginning user whose main motivation will be to take photos of albums to get a greater understanding of what they are thinking of purchasing. As people progress with their collection over time, so will their profile/subscription. The more people add to the forums or find and document new and old albums will help grow the database/library of ‘Discovered Wax’. When the user adds to the library they will acquire points and status. Based on their particular interest in either genre of music, equipment, upcoming events etc the users will be able to create a following and be awarded by the company with points so they can acquire or select either albums or equipment from the company store.
  </p>

  <p>This will also serve as a detailed catalogue for the individual user. As collections grow it can be hard to remember exactly what you have. When you take a snapshot of the album the app will tell you if you have it or not.
  </p>

  <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>

  <p>Discovered Wax would be an application on any smartphone or tablet and would utilize reliable image Recognition technology on a massive scale. Utilizing technology such as Vuforia Cloud Recognition will be able to recognise and track millions of images. As well as using cloud-based services from Amazon web services which is great as we start out with its Auto scaling so there is less chance of crashing due to fluctuations in traffic.
  </p>

  <h3>
  Skills Required </h3>
  <p>Using python or any other transcript to create an algorithm to help users discover new music/records that fit their preferences based on specific genres and time periods of music that they currently have in their digital and physical library. As well as show the user different bands or albums they may be interested which again will be governed by the previous purchases and current library.</p>

  <h3>End result</h3>

  <p>The outcome of this application being successful will be helping beginner and seasoned Vinyl collectors and audiophile enthusiasts to be more informed with purchases, communicate/Discuss and be part of a global audio community. Discovered Wax in a few ways is a middle man for users to discover other music genres, releases, band information and different audio technology.
