  <h3>Nerdy Personality Attributes Scale - Score 49
  </h3>

  <h3>What do the results of these tests mean?</h3>

  <p>In a couple of ways, it does loosely make sense with the personality attributes. I have always found that I like to think of myself in these ways. But I have never acted towards these attributes it more or less just seems like the right thing to do at the time. I’ve always known I was a visual learner. To see a task in front of me and pull it apart to simplify the topic to get a deeper and clearer understanding. For the nerd test, I thought I might have scored higher. I have never considered myself a nerd but have been drawn to nerdy things and have been ridiculed because of a new hobby that is seen as nerdy - 4 years and too much money on Warhammer when I was a teenager
  </p>

  <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>

  <p>I think my personality does encourage people to feel welcome and not judged. I always try to involve others and make sure that no one is left behind or doesn’t have their voice heard. The only drawback I see is that I prefer to visually see the breakdown of the task/assignment. Being an online course there may be some challenges I will encounter</p>
  
  <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?
  </h3>

  <p>With teamwork, I feel the biggest issue is when you have people together that learn in different ways. I have always been comfortable working with both extra/introverts finding a common interest to build from and allowing people to get their ideas heard. But when some people can mentally map out and understand a topic I have been lost and felt like I was letting the team down.
